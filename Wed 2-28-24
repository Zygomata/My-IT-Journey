Yesterday was Wednesday 2/28 and I learned about  the basics of Operating Systems, VMs, and how we will use them in the course. I also learned about networking on a high level.
So far due to my past experience, in the google career certificate, I am not having any issues with the course and am trying to absorb as much information as possible.
