This is the start of my journey into the world of IT. I previously had no experience in the field, but it has intrigued me for a while and I wish to switch careers. 


I previously thought I could directly break into cybersecurity without a degree, so I took the Google career certificate. 
After further research, it came to my attention that it would be difficult to do that with just the career certificate as cybersecurity is NOT entry-level. 
After further research, I concluded that the best way to start  is by entering the field with an IT helpdesk position as from there I can further my skills. gain certifications, and gain more on-the-job experience in the field. 

I found an entry-level IT helpdesk course online taught by coursecareers and have been doing that since. I started on Monday 2/26/24, and it is currently Wednesday 2/28. 
Since I took the career certificate from Google, a lot of the theoretical portion of the course felt similar so it didn't feel like I am starting from scratch. 

I hope to keep you all up-to-date on how the course goes as well as my journey in IT.
