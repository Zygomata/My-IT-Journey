It has been a week since the last entry that I made for my IT journey. 
So far in the past few days I have created multiple projects. I was able to setup a ticketing system (osTicket), as well as learn and set up a VPN in Azure.
With that being said I have learned about the basics of Azure and how to setup VMs and resource groups within Azure.
